# Status Quo

## [2026-05-18 12:57] TokenAltar MVP Bootstrap
- **Changes:** Created the Rust Axum/SQLite backend, Vue/Vite console, SQLite migrations, OpenAI Responses and Anthropic Messages gateway adapters, routing/affinity/fire-sale logic, MPSC ledger worker, pricing engine, tests, README, and ignore rules.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Configure real upstream channels in the console, run with production admin credentials, and add provider-specific streaming event normalization as usage grows.
- **Context:** MVP rejects multimodal and reasoning/thinking extensions; token precheck uses a conservative local estimator while final settlement uses upstream usage.

## [2026-05-18 13:27] Full PRD Completion Pass
- **Changes:** Added Chat Completions gateway support, tiktoken-based precheck, quota window refresh/status transitions, invite settings, P2P transfers, red packets, monthly leaderboards, anonymous ranking, and a complete Vue console for the new workflows.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Configure production upstream channels and run an external-provider smoke test with real API keys.
- **Context:** Multimodal and reasoning/thinking payloads remain intentionally outside the text/tool MVP boundary; Anthropic local precheck uses the documented proxy estimator while settlement uses returned usage.

## [2026-05-18 14:14] Neoclassical Console Redesign
- **Changes:** Reworked the Vue console into a neoclassical control surface, added typed tab metadata and dashboard metric cards, replaced the global visual system with stone/gold/bronze accented responsive layouts, and added `frontend/public/altar-relief.svg` as a local decorative relief asset.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Review with real production channel/ledger data to tune table density if rows become very wide.
- **Context:** Verified with `pnpm --dir frontend build` plus Playwright desktop/mobile login and dashboard/channel screenshots against a temporary local backend.

## [2026-05-18 14:28] Oil Painting Background Asset
- **Changes:** Moved the generated `image.png` into `frontend/public/tokenaltar-background.png` and wired it into the login hero, ambient shell artwork, and page header background treatments.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Rebuilt the frontend and checked login/dashboard desktop and mobile rendering with Playwright against a temporary local backend.

## [2026-05-18 14:53] Owner Channel Pricing
- **Changes:** Opened channel creation to regular users, redacted upstream API secrets from console channel responses, owner-scoped regular-user channel reads, added channel-specific model price overrides with global fallback, and updated the Vue pricing scope controls.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Run a production smoke test with one regular-user channel and one admin global default price.
- **Context:** Gateway routing still uses full internal channel records, while console APIs return masked channel DTOs; channel prices override global model patterns only for the selected upstream channel.

## [2026-05-18 15:21] Text Protocol Compatibility Pass
- **Changes:** Reworked the gateway protocol layer into a text-only client/provider protocol matrix, added same-protocol passthrough for OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini Generate Content, added cross-protocol text conversion paths, introduced Gemini upstream channels and routes, and updated README/frontend provider selection.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Add provider-specific golden fixtures as real upstream incompatibilities are found.
- **Context:** new-api was cloned to `/tmp/tokenaltar-new-api-reference` for architecture reference only; no third-party source was copied into this repository.

## [2026-05-18 15:31] Text Protocol Boundary Tightening
- **Changes:** Narrowed Gemini path handling so the route action only influences temporary parse state, kept affinity/body inspection on the original request payload, and added a regression test to verify Gemini same-protocol passthrough does not leak internal fields.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Text-only protocol support remains limited to chat/responses/messages/gemini generate content; embeddings, rerank, images, and realtime are still out of scope.

## [2026-05-18 15:58] Antikythera Hero Refinement
- **Changes:** Removed Platonic Solids and Janus hero overlays, kept only the animated Antikythera mechanism layer, and fixed the mid-width login hero overlap by adding container-query breakpoints, safer grid tracks, and an optional word-break point in the TokenAltar title.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Verified `pnpm --dir frontend build`; checked 1366x900 and 2048x1373 hero/title/card geometry for no overlap and zero horizontal page overflow.

## [2026-05-18 17:57] Daily Leaderboards
- **Changes:** Added day/month leaderboard periods, success-only leaderboard aggregation, configurable leaderboard window timezone via `TOKENALTAR_LEADERBOARD_TIMEZONE`, Vue day/month controls, README documentation, and regression coverage for daily filtering.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Set `TOKENALTAR_LEADERBOARD_TIMEZONE` in production if the deployment should use a fixed IANA timezone such as `Asia/Shanghai`.
- **Context:** Defaults to the server local timezone when the environment variable is unset; leaderboard window starts are converted to SQLite UTC datetime strings before querying ledger rows.

## [2026-05-18 16:24] Image Input Protocol Support
- **Changes:** Extended the shared protocol layer to parse and serialize image parts for OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini Generate Content; added conservative image token prechecks; added Gemini image normalization in the gateway so external URLs are fetched and converted to `inlineData` before forwarding; updated tests and README gateway notes.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Add provider-specific edge cases if a live upstream rejects any of the accepted image shapes.
- **Context:** Same-protocol passthrough remains direct; cross-protocol text plus image conversion is intentionally minimal and limited to the current text API surface.

## [2026-05-18 19:43] Management Controls Deepening
- **Changes:** Added API key update/rotate/batch-delete lifecycle controls, channel update/copy/test/batch-enable lifecycle controls, soft-delete visibility rules, gateway model allow-list enforcement, and a polished console for filtering, selecting, editing, testing, cloning, and retiring keys/channels.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Smoke test one real upstream channel health check and one rotated client key in production credentials.
- **Context:** Channel and API key deletion is soft to preserve ledger history; empty channel API key updates keep the existing upstream secret.

## [2026-05-18 22:25] Fire Sale Reset Window Fix
- **Changes:** Corrected fire-sale activation so it requires both the remaining-token threshold and a real UTC distance-to-reset window before applying discounted routing/pricing.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Confirm production billing reset timezone expectations if they should differ from the existing UTC channel-window logic.
- **Context:** Targeted pricing tests cover in-window, out-of-window, reset-day, and remaining-threshold behavior.

## [2026-05-18 22:32] Affinity Cache TTL Fix
- **Changes:** Stored affinity expiration timestamps inside the in-memory LRU cache and dropped expired cache hits before routing.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** SQLite affinity bindings remain the source of truth; the cache now mirrors DB TTL instead of treating a cached channel ID as permanent.

## [2026-05-18 22:34] Rolling Surge Window Fix
- **Changes:** Replaced the permanent surge token counter with a rolling one-hour in-memory token window using minute buckets.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Surge pricing now bases its load ratio on recent gateway settlements instead of all settlements since process start.

## [2026-05-18 22:41] Gateway Reservation Safety
- **Changes:** Added atomic gateway request reservations for estimated points and channel tokens, released reservations on upstream failure, settled only final deltas, guarded duplicate ledger side effects, and made P2P transfer debits conditional on available balance.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Consider moving reservation state to a durable recovery table if the process must survive crashes between reserve and settlement.
- **Context:** Existing gateway integration tests pass; new tests cover reservation release and settlement delta accounting.

## [2026-05-18 23:23] Arbitrary Channel Quota Windows
- **Changes:** Replaced fixed cycle/day/hour quota handling with arbitrary per-channel quota windows, added normalized SQLite window storage, switched reservation/settlement/routing/surge/fire-sale logic to the unified window path, and updated the Vue channel console to create and display any number of windows.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Configure production channels with the exact upstream billing windows and timezones before routing live traffic.
- **Context:** Each window is a hard quota constraint; the first window is the primary inventory window used for dashboard availability, routing weight, and fire-sale reset timing.

## [2026-05-18 23:29] Quota Window Count Contract
- **Changes:** Removed the artificial per-channel quota window count cap so the API accepts any positive number of windows while still requiring each window to have valid period and anchor semantics.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Runtime cost scales linearly with configured windows because every gateway reservation checks all channel windows atomically.

## [2026-05-18 23:41] Role Aware Console UI
- **Changes:** Hid admin-only Affinity navigation from regular users, adjusted user-facing channel/pricing copy, guarded regular-user price saves without a channel, and added owner labels to admin channel/pricing tables.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Add action-level error toasts and confirmations for destructive channel/key operations.
- **Context:** Backend permissions are unchanged; this is a UI clarity pass over existing role boundaries.

## [2026-05-19 12:47] Gateway Failure Retry
- **Changes:** Reworked gateway upstream dispatch into a bounded retry loop for connection errors, 408, 429, and 5xx responses; failed attempts now release reservations, apply a short channel cooldown, retry another healthy channel when affinity fallback is allowed, and update affinity bindings on successful fallback.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Tune retry/cooldown knobs from production traffic if upstream providers need different backoff behavior.
- **Context:** `skip_retry_on_failure=true` still pins bound affinity traffic to the bound channel and returns its error; streaming requests retry only before a successful upstream stream begins.

## [2026-05-19 13:03] Leaderboard Redesign
- **Changes:** Redesigned the Vue leaderboard tab with typed ranking rows, summary metrics, ranked provider/consumer boards, score bars, anonymity labels, empty states, and responsive mobile layout.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** None.
- **Context:** Backend leaderboard semantics are unchanged; verification used a temporary `/tmp` SQLite database with seeded demo ledger rows for visual inspection.

## [2026-05-19 13:31] Embedded Frontend Assets
- **Changes:** Embedded the built Vue console assets into the Rust binary with `rust-embed`, replaced the runtime `ServeDir` fallback with an embedded asset handler, removed the `TOKENALTAR_FRONTEND_DIST` runtime config, and added an integration test for SPA fallback from embedded assets.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Run `pnpm --dir frontend build` before compiling Rust whenever the console changes so the binary includes fresh assets.
- **Context:** Runtime deployment no longer needs a `frontend/dist` directory; release smoke test passed from a temporary directory containing only the copied binary and SQLite database.
